The "python battery notification" GitHub repository contains a Python script that sends notifications to the user when their laptop's battery reaches a certain percentage level. The script periodically checks the laptop's battery level and sends a desktop notification using the plyer library when the battery level falls below a certain threshold. The user can configure the battery threshold and the time interval between checks in the script. This repository can be useful for those who want to monitor their laptop battery's status and receive notifications when the battery level is low.
